## Project Overview

This repository accompanies an experimental study investigating how response latency (Fast vs. Slow) and response complexity (Easy vs. Hard) influence user trust in AI-generated health advice.

The study utilized a 2x2 within-subjects design implemented via a custom web application. Participants (N=39) interacted with a simulated AI across four health scenarios, rating the perceived trustworthiness and quality of the responses under different experimental conditions.

The primary goal was to examine the main effects of latency and complexity, as well as their interaction effect, on perceived quality perception focusing on trustworthiness along with other metrics.

## Repository Contents & Availability

**Please Note:** <font color="red">**This repository currently only contains the `backend`, `deployment-modules`, and `firebase-administration-scripts` folders.**</font> The full project materials, including the `frontend` (study UI), `gradio_app` (main latency/complexity study section), and `results` (anonymized data, analysis scripts, figures) directories, are currently undergoing necessary cleanup and sanitization before being added.

**The complete project contents will be uploaded to this repository by April 16th.**
